## Server-side Caching

* `GET` queries are cached (per API Key) for a small amount of time. Usually about 3 minutes. Check the HTTP headers sent by our servers for an exact value.
* `POST` queries are never cached.

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

* `GET` endpoints support 1 `Cross-origin resource sharing` per API key. Contact api@newswhip.com to set this up.
* `POST` endpoints are server-side only.
